      <h2><i>Fun Facts</i></h2>
      <p>
        As the capital city of Louisiana, Baton Rouge is the heart and soul of
        the state’s eclectic culture. With over 300 years of history, Baton
        Rouge has a colorful story to tell, which can be tasted through our
        culinary offerings, seen through the picturesque views of the
        Mississippi River and historical landmarks and experienced through the
        vibrant arts and culture scene.

        and let us make the planning easy – we’ll be waiting to welcome you with
        Southern hospitality and an authentic Louisiana experience!
