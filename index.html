      <h2 id="europeansettlement">European Settlement</h2>
      <p>
        French colonists established a trading post and military in 1721 at the
        site of a Muscogee boundary marker called a bâton rouge, or "red stick".
        The city's name comes from this marker.
      </p>

      <h2 id="spanishinfluence">Spanish Influence</h2>
      <p>
        In 1779, the Spanish defeated the English at Fort Butte and captured
        Baton Rouge. During Spanish Colonial occupation, the city was part of
        West Florida and a fort called Fort San Carlos was built on the river.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Spanish allowed French settlers to maintain their language and
        customs, but in 1766, the first Spanish colonial governor, Don Antonio
        de Ulloa, imposed trade restrictions that angered the settlers. In 1768,
        the settlers rebelled and forced de Ulloa out, but Spain retook the
        colony in 1769.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1805, the Spanish Town District was founded, which is now the oldest
        neighborhood in the city and has the oldest architecture.
      </p>

      <h2 id="civilwar">Civil War</h2>
      <p>
        Baton Rouge was under Union control for most of the Civil War, except
        for a brief period in 1862.
      </p>

      <h2 id="othernotableevents">Other Events</h2>
      <p>
        In 1810, local settlers overthrew the Spanish and declared the area the
        West Florida Republic. Baton Rouge was incorporated in 1817 and became
        the state capital in 1849.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1846, the city replaced New Orleans as the state capital and
        construction began on the Neo-Gothic capitol building, which is now a
        National Historic Landmark. Baton Rouge was also the site of the first
        major boycott of the South during the Civil Rights Movement, when
        African Americans refused to ride segregated buses. The boycott sparked
        a national conversation and led to other notable protests.
