        European settlement French colonists established a trading post and
        military in 1721 at the site of a Muscogee boundary marker called a
        bâton rouge, or "red stick". The city's name comes from this marker.

      <p>
        In 1779, the Spanish defeated the English at Fort
        Butte and captured Baton Rouge. During Spanish Colonial occupation, the
        city was part of West Florida and a fort called Fort San Carlos was
        built on the river. The Spanish allowed French settlers to maintain
        their language and customs, but in 1766, the first Spanish colonial
        governor, Don Antonio de Ulloa, imposed trade restrictions that angered
        the settlers. In 1768, the settlers rebelled and forced de Ulloa out,
        but Spain retook the colony in 1769. In 1805, the Spanish Town District
        was founded, which is now the oldest neighborhood in the city and has
        the oldest architecture.

        Baton Rouge was under Union control for most of the Civil War,
        except for a brief period in 1862.

        In 1810, local settlers overthrew the Spanish and
        declared the area the West Florida Republic. Baton Rouge was
        incorporated in 1817 and became the state capital in 1849. In 1846, the
        city replaced New Orleans as the state capital and construction began on
        the Neo-Gothic capitol building, which is now a National Historic
        Landmark. Baton Rouge was also the site of the first major boycott of
        the South during the Civil Rights Movement, when African Americans
        refused to ride segregated buses. The boycott sparked a national
        conversation and led to other notable protests.
